InteractiveStoryApp

About this App:

One of the most fundamental types of apps you can create is one with a hierarchical data model and style of navigation. In this course we're going to learn exactly how to do that by building an interactive story app. We'll cover a lot of ground by exploring navigation controllers, hierarchical data models and custom view controllers. We'll go over how to accept user input, how to create and layout views programmatically, how to play sound effects and much more. At the end of this course, you will have the knowledge to build many of the basic apps you see in the app store.


What you'll learn:

UINavigationController
Notifications
Layout anchors and constraints
Audio APIs
